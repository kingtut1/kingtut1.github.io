Ok I am the only thing showing.

##Welcome to kingtut1's Project
This site displays my past works and even some of my current one's. 

##Game Design
Current Game: This is not a Game
This game is about mental health in young adults. We explore the mind of a teenage girl and her own maze through life. This is a first and third person game that includes puzzle elements. Coming soon.

##Programs
Random resturant generator. This application asks for a price range and which it will generate a resturant for you to go to based on your price range. Release: Early 2018.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kingtut1/kingtut1.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kingtut1/kingtut1.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
